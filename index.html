        <h4>Product Manager Internship</h4>
        <p>2023</p>
        <p>
          As a Product Manager Intern, I worked with the product team to help
          drive the development of our internal applications. I was responsible
          for helping to define the product vision, strategy, and roadmap. I
          also worked with various stakeholders and the development team to help
          define and prioritize features and requirements. Additionally, I
          performed end-to-end testing and soliticted feedback from end-users to
          make sure that we were able to fix bugs prior to production, and
          quickly identify any regressions thereafter.
